##Title: 8 tips to succeed as a startup

I’m sure you are an entrepreneur! 
One day you just realized that you found the perfect business idea and you are so excited about it, you want to pursue it and you can’t even believe that no one has ever thought about doing that before. 
Well, maybe they have, but if it didn’t work for them, it will definitely work for you. You know you have that extra something: motivation, passion, availability, vision, commitment and so many other adjectives that will, by themselves, set you up for success.

If you relate to what you just read, I’m sorry, but I’m about to burst your bubble. Do a quick search online and you will find all kinds of articles and studies stating that about 70% of all new businesses fail. 

We don’t want that to happen to you, that’s why we made a list of 8 important things that you need to remember in order to keep your head up and float.


Do something you love
This should be the starting point if you want to establish your own business - you need to love it! If you are truly passionate about your idea, your product or service, this will really show when you talk about it. Also, that way you will be more than willing to put in the extra effort required in the beginning (a startup is hardly built on only a 40h week schedule) and you are less prone to give up when things get hard. So make sure that this is an idea that occupies a special place in your heart.

Offer a real solution, to a real problem
Again, a super important thing to have in mind. Loving the idea is very important, but please do your homework on the market demand. Never forget that you need to serve your customers, not yourself! And if you keep pushing on the market something that only you like, maybe the company will not last long. Try to adjust or adapt your idea to what people are really needing and therefore will buy.


Don’t be afraid of competition
Don’t see competition as a bad thing. Imagine being the only one doing something? Doesn't it sound difficult? If no one else is talking or working on the same problem it is only up to you to stir the waters on that subject, and that can be really hard. Also, if you have competition, it is because the topic is hot and you are definitely on to something. Just be vigilant and don’t let others invade your product's space.

Learn from criticism
“If you fall 10 times, get up 11!” someone said. So, if you hear 10 critics, don’t get angry or negative about things. Au contraire, welcome those 10 comments and see them as something that can help you improve aspects of your business. Always see the silver lining.



Develop an elevator pitch
These days we have so many stimuli that it is hard to focus on something for a long time. So, if you want to convince anyone that they should take a second look at your company, you will have about 30 s to capture their attention. Develop a good, strong elevator pitch that will make people curious about your products and show your potential. That way, you might get a chance for more time later.

Network, network, network
When you are starting a business having connections are key to maintaining you afloat. And when you already have traction in your business, connections will continue to be powerful allies. Remember, it’s important to find people in real life at conferences and events, but also don’t look away from the power of social media and e-events. And of course, when you are already established, don’t forget to also help others that are starting.

Create content and an online presence
We live in the online age, so nothing seems to be more important these days than getting yourself known in the online world. For that, you need to create good content, to attract a qualified audience. Don’t be afraid to go deep into blogging, creating videos, podcasts or any other formats of content that can reach your customers. Talk about what you know and about what your product can do to help overcome your customers' problems. That way, you will establish yourself as an authority in that subject, get people to connect with you, trust you more and ultimately, buy your products.

Take care of yourself
You are your most important asset. No money will pay you compromising your health or well-being. So make sure you work hard, but also find the time to play hard. Having a balance between work and personal life will also relax your mind, make it more open to new ideas and avoid you suffering from burnout (which would cause more damage than good to your business).
