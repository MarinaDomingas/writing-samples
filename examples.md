#Sample 1 – Project newsletter
- Link
- The purpose of this newsletter was to disseminate what happened at the last MediaMotorEurope project event (Mediatech on stage)
- I wrote and graphically composed all the newsletter. I even made the gif using images extracted from the recording of the event.
- The project manager that worked with me on this project reviewed the newsletter.
- For the newsletter we usually set up a graphical template at the beginning of the project and then always follow it. In terms of content, the objective was to tell what happened on the event.
- This newsletter took me about 3h30 hours to compose, between deciding what to write and actually writing it, plus the time to make the gif (+-30min)


Sample 2 – Open call page
•	Link
•	The purpose of this page is to explain a technical open call, to a less technical audience, in order to get them to apply. The project is looking for people that have daily problems that can be solved or improved by using AI planning algorithms.
•	I wrote the text on that page and composed the infographic.
•	A partner that works deeply in the AI planning field reviewed the text.
•	To compose the open call texts, usually what I have is a “Proposal Agreement”. This is a document where the partners specify what is their vision for the project and what they commit to do, to achieve the expected results. I also have the help of the technical partners to help clarify any technical doubts I might have. Since the goal here is to explain this in a simple way to the general public.
•	Understanding well enough all the specificities of the project to be able to break it down in the simplest possible way, took me about 6 months and a lot of attended meetings to observe the technical partners. Actually writing this text took me 3 iterations of a day each. 


Sample 3 – Press release of a new project
•	Link
•	The purpose of this text was for the partners to publish on their websites. As well to be published on the project´s website, once the website is ready.
•	I wrote the text and composed the visual.
•	The project manager of this project reviewed the text.
•	I had the “Proposal Agreement” and I attended a in-person meeting with all the partners where they explained the project in detail.
•	Writing this text took me about 2hours.
